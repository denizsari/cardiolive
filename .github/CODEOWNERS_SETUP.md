# üõ†Ô∏è CODEOWNERS Configuration Helper

This file helps you configure the CODEOWNERS file with your actual GitHub usernames.

## How to Update CODEOWNERS

1. Open `.github/CODEOWNERS` file
2. Replace `@your-username` with your actual GitHub username
3. Add team members if you have any

## Example:

If your GitHub username is `johndoe` and you have a team member `janedoe`, update like this:

```
# CardioLive Code Owners
* @johndoe

# Frontend team
/frontend/ @johndoe @janedoe

# Backend team  
/backend/ @johndoe

# DevOps and Infrastructure
/.github/ @johndoe
/docker/ @johndoe
/deployment/ @johndoe
```

## Team-based Ownership (Optional)

If you have GitHub teams, you can use team names:

```
# Using GitHub teams
* @your-org/cardiolive-team
/frontend/ @your-org/frontend-team
/backend/ @your-org/backend-team
```

## Current Configuration

The current CODEOWNERS file uses placeholder usernames. Update them with your actual GitHub usernames for the code review system to work properly.
